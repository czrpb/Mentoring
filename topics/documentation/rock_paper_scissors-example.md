## Motivation

Rock Paper Scissors is a simple and fun decision-making process. Choosing between 2 options is actually not always clear. At some point a decision just needs to be made so progress towards the goal does not become stalled.

Rock Paper Scissors makes the choosing simple, quick and fun!

## Influences

Due to the dispursed geographic nature of our team, we need an asynchronous distributed solution which allows the decision-making participants a way to start, execute and finalize a decision.
