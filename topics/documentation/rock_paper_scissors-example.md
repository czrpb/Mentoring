## Motivation

Rock Paper Scissors is a fun game and can also be used as a decision-making process. Choosing between 2 options is actually not always clear. At some point a decision just needs to be made so progress towards the goal does not become stalled.

**`Distributed Rock Paper Scissors` makes the choosing simple, quick and fun!**

> NOTE: `DRPS` is only a method for choosing between previous generate options which are consider roughtly equivalent and the team cant seem to come to a consensus on.

## Influences

Due to the dispursed geographic nature of our team, we need an asynchronous distributed solution which allows the decision-making participants a way to start, execute and finalize a decision.
