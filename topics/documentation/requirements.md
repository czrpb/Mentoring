## Basic Outline

Here are the minimum sections you should have:

1. **Identification**: Title, Author, Date, etc
1. **Motivation**: Why is the SW being written?
1. **Influences**: What concepts -- -- are influencing the purpose, design and construction of the SW?
1. **Context**: Who is the SW for? How is to be run?
1. **Design**: What is the high-level design?
1. **Specification**: What are the SW's: interfaces, functions, useability, etc.
1. **Validation**: How is the SW to be tested?

## Details

### Identification

Provide the following:

1. Title
1. Author
1. Date
1. State

    a. One of: `DRAFT`, `UNDER REVIEW`, `FINAL`
1. asdf

### Motivation

This section goes by a number of other terms such as (business) *purpose* or *need*.

The purpose of this section is to describe:

1. why the software should exist
1. who the software is for
1. asdf


### Influences

This purpose of this section is . . .

### Context

This section is sometimes called *environment*.

The purpose of this section is to describe the conditions under which the software is expected to operate. It should also describe conditions and constraints in which the software is expected to degrade or cease to function altogether.

Examples of relevant information:

1. Hardware (system) requirement
1. asdf

### Design Overview

This section is sometimes called *(system) architecture*.

#### Use Cases

#### Personas

#### Diagrams

Useful diagrams include:

* [Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram)
* [Activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_diagram)
* [Causal Loop](https://thesystemsthinker.com/causal-loop-construction-the-basics/)
* [State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram)

### Requirements Specification

#### Interfaces

Describe the interfaces:

* The SW as a black box


#### Functional

#### Useability

#### Observability

#### Sustainability

### Verification

This section is sometimes called *(software or system) testing*.
