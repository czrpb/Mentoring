# Projects

Here is a list and links to more detail
for a number of projects, which I
define as non-trival in concept and
implementation.

## Grep

See the exercism exercise:

https://exercism.org/tracks/racket/exercises/grep

This exercise is also available in the Elixir
and Python tracks (and probably most others
on Exercism).

[Grep](grep.md)

## Identify File Types

In this project you will categorize all
the files found in a directory and its
sub-directories.

the following image types:

[Project: Identify Images](image-file-types.md)

### Type: Music

In this variant, you will categorize any of
the following music types:

  * mp4
  * midi

## Partial Implementation fo LZ Compression

In this project, you will implement a bit of
the LZ77/78 compression algorithm.

### Nano LZ77/78

In this variant, the amount of input text
supported will be quite small.
