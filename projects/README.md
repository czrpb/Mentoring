# Projects

Here is a list and links to more detail
for a number of projects, which I
define as non-trival in concept and
implementation.

## Grep

See the exercism exercise:

https://exercism.org/tracks/racket/exercises/grep

This exercise is also available in the Elixir
and Python tracks (and probably most others
on Exercism).

## Identify Image File Types

In this project you will categorize all
the image files found in a directory and its
sub-directories.

There is a version for music file types; see
below.
